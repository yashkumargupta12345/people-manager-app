## Deployment (SSR/Prerender)

- Static routes (`/`, `/create`) are prerendered.
- Dynamic routes (`/edit/:id`, `/delete/:id`) use server-side rendering.

If you see errors about prerendering parameterized routes, check [`src/app/app.routes.server.ts`](src/app/app.routes.server.ts) for correct `renderMode` settings.

---

## Customization

- To change fields, update [`person.model.ts`](src/app/person.model.ts) and related components.
- To style, edit [`app.css`](src/app/app.css).
